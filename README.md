# Bitcoin Platinum

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BitcoinPlatinum/BitcoinPlatinum.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BitcoinPlatinum/BitcoinPlatinum)

Bitcoin Platinum (codename EVA-02) is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that will occur at block height X, at roughly XX:00:00 UTC November X, 2017.

At the predetermined block height, Bitcoin Platinum miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and this will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue on unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. The new branch is a distinct blockchain with the same transaction history as Bitcoin up until the fork, but then diverges from it. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency will be born.

## WARNING

Bitcoin Platinum is a work in progress. If you don’t understand what you are doing, please don’t compile and run your own client from the staging tree. Your own client will **NOT WORK** for both testnet and mainnet. However, you're more than welcome to help test the code and join the development.
